It’s powered by an incredible 5-litre twin-turbo V8 that delivers an eye-watering 1,360kg and 1,573Nm of torque. It’s equipped with a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox and sends all of its power to the rear wheels. It’s also super light, tipping the scales at 1,395kg, and it’s easily the most expensive car Mat has ever drag-raced, with an estimated value of £3,500,000!! \n\nAlongside it, we have the Tesla Model S Plaid. It’s equipped with three motors, and they combine to put down 1,020hp and 1,420Nm, with all of this power being sent to all four wheels. Naturally, being electric, it’s weighed down a bit by the batteries and motors, and as a result, it weighs in at 2,190kg. \n\nThen finally we have the Hayabusa. But this is no usual Suzuki Hayabusa! It’s had a supercharger fitted to it, and as a result, its 1.3-litre 4-cylinder engine produces 385hp and 280Nm of torque! This power is sent to the rear wheels, and of course, it’s oh-so light, weighing in at 257kg. \n\nSo how will this one play out - will the electric power of the Tesla propel it to victory? Or will either the Koenigsegg or Hayabusa sneak it? There’s only one way to find out… LET’S RACE!\n\n\nMat’s quickest 1/4-mile EVER: https://bit.ly/Mats-Quickest-Launch-Ever\n\nFerrari SF90 v Tesla Model S Plaid v Porsche 911 Turbo S: https://bit.ly/Ferrari-SF90-v-Model-S-Plaid-v-911-Turbo\n\nSell your car with carwow: https://bit.ly/Buy-Sell-WOW",

When tasked with bringing these iconic childhood toys to life on the big screen, Greta Gerwig enlisted the skills of production designer Sarah Greenwood and set decorator Katie Spencer. Taking inspiration from Palm Springs midcentury modernism they’ve created a whimsical fuchsia pink fantasy where slides replace stairs and there’s not a wall in sight–when touring this impressive set it’s hard not to feel a rush of playful nostalgia as Greta states “I wanted to capture what was so ridiculously fun about the Dreamhouses.\" Barbie hits theaters on July 21.\r\n\r\nPromotional Consideration BARBIE from Warner Bros.
